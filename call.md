## Abstract
The increasing complexity, criticality and pervasiveness of software results in new challenges for testing. Model Based Testing (MBT) continues to be an important research area, where new approaches, methods and tools make MBT techniques (for automatic test case generation) more deployable and useful for industry than ever. Following the success of previous editions, the goal of the A-MOST workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners together to discuss state of the art, practice and future prospects in MBT.
Topics and sub-topics (not exhaustive): 
* The models used in MBT
  * Models for component, integration and system testing
  * Test models for systems of systems, non-deterministic systems, real-time embedded systems, and hybrid (continuous/discrete) systems 
  *	Models for non-functional aspects (e.g., security, safety, reliability)
  *	Environment and usage models
  * Formal, semi-formal, and restricted-natural-language models
* The processes, techniques, and tools that support MBT
  *	Algorithms for automatic test case generation from models
  *	Coverage criteria to guide and assess test case generation
  *	Application of model checking techniques for test case generation
  *	Application of machine learning techniques to automatically derive, augment and evolve test models 
  *	Model-based mutation testing
  *	Generation of testing-infrastructures from models
  * Combinatorial approaches for model-based statistical testing
  * Integrated model-based approaches for simulation, testing, and run-time monitoring
  * Traceability in MBT 
  * Test model evolution during the software lifecycle
  * Integration of MBT in agile and DevOps contexts
* Evaluation (evaluation of software using MBT and evaluation of MBT)
  * Performance measures in MBT
  * Cost of testing and economic impact of MBT 
  * Empirical validation, experiences, and case studies using MBT 

## Submission format
### Full and short papers
Papers should not exceed 8 pages for full papers or 4 pages for short experience and position papers (including all text, figures, references - but it is not a strict limit, if you need more space contact the chairs). Each submitted paper must conform to the IEEE two-column publication format. Papers will be reviewed by at least three members from the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Digital Library.
### Communication abstracts
We also solicit communication abstracts (talk proposals within 1 page) this year, which may be based on already published papers in relevant well- known venues (conferences or journals) or purely industrial-oriented experience. These will be selected based on their relevance and quality. Selected abstracts will be presented and discussed in the workshop, similar to the regular papers, but will not be included in the proceedings. Though, their titles and abstracts will be mentioned in the workshop summary.
